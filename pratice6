5. The Miser and His Gold
Once upon a time, there lived a man in a small town. The man was a miser. He used to collect all his earnings and spent very little. He loved his gold more than anything else. So he decided and buried all his gold in a secret spot in his garden. 

Each day, he would dig it up, count it, and then bury it again. One day, as per his daily ritual, the miser man was counting his gold, a thief saw everything.
