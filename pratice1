7. The Ant and the Grasshopper
One sunny day, a family of ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine. Some carrying grains, while some drying them out in the sun. There also lived a grasshopper close to the green fields. The happy go lucky grasshopper, always spent his time singing and dancing in the garden. His friend was one of the ants who were collecting the grains. Even at the peak of summer, the ant carried food grains from the fields on her bag and kept storing them safely in her home. The grasshopper always made fun of the hard-working ant and kept on spending his days leisurely.
